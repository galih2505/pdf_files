Purpose: Peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation has become increasingly popular in recent years, and hotels are facing unprecedented impacts. Attracting new consumers and retaining existing ones are critical to the success of P2P accommodation and hotels. The purpose of this paper is to examine three categories of antecedents for hotels consumersâ€™ switching intention: push (i.e. satiation), pull (i.e. perceived value) and mooring (i.e. optimal stimulation level) factors using pushâ€“pullâ€“mooring (PPM) model. Design/methodology/approach: Airbnb was chosen as the research context. An online survey was conducted to examine the proposed research model and hypotheses. A total of 292 valid data were collected from Airbnb users through a survey. Findings: The findings show that the three categories of factors have positive and significant effects on switching intention. Additionally, the mooring factor has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between pull factors and switching intention. Furthermore, the mooring factor affects both pull and push factors. Originality/value: First, this is one of the early studies to pay attention to switching intention from hotels to P2P accommodation. Second, to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumersâ€™ switching intention, the authors use PPM model to establish the research framework. This research improves the understanding of consumerâ€™s switching intention by identifying the push and pull factors based on the differences between hotels and P2P accommodation in accordance with optimal stimulation level theory and consumer value theory.

Total Quality Management (TQM) can be used for business process improvement to achieve the quality service in the hotel business. The objective of this paper is to identify the suitable Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for implementing TQM in the Hotel industry. Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) analysis is done to identify the importance of CSFs. Web based analysis is used to analysis the AHP. The study has identified the suitable TQMâ€™s CSFs of such as customer satisfaction or focus, top management commitment and leadership and employee involvement or focus or satisfaction are important CSFs to implement the TQM in the hotel industry. Based on the AHP analysis, the study has identified the suitable CSFs of TQM related to customer focus or satisfaction (CF = 0.4288), top management and leadership (TM = 0.2548) and employee involvement (EI = 0.2346) are important CSFs to implement the TQM in the hotel industry. The least importance is given to Continuous improvement (CP = 0.0818). Â© BEIESP.
Success in the hotel industry depends heavily on customer satisfaction, which is highly affected by the quality of service provided by a satisfied workforce. Luxury summer resorts represent an interesting setting for investigating job satisfaction (JS). Hotels in this end of the market face higher customer quality expectations and depend heavily, in order to fulfill these expectations, on a diversified force of seasonal employees. To investigate the key factors that drive overall JS of seasonal employees in summer luxury resorts a survey was conducted in a single setting. The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was combined with the MUlticriteria Satisfaction Analysis (MUSA), demonstrating that MUSA can be an effective decision making tool also in the area of human resource management. Principal component and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a four-factor structure of the MSQ construct: Empowerment, Task enrichment, HRM policies and Leadership qualities. Moreover, MUSA indicated that Empowerment was the critical factor of JS of seasonal employees. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd
Purpose: Organizational learning (OL) represents the real value and the heart of strategic management, the focal point to keep track of international development. This paper aims to investigate the effect of knowledge management (KM) on the development of OL capability (OLC) in international hotels installed in Algeria. Design/methodology/approach: This deductive descriptive case study research examines the impact of KM, using knowledge conversion process (KCP) on the development of OLC. In all, 70 expatriates were targeted to respond to questionnaires, while only 47 were valid for analysis. Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the influential processes on OLC. Findings: The socialization, externalization and internalization have a direct positive significant effect on the development of OLC. Socialization is the major influencing factor. However, the combination has no effect on OLC. In sum, KM has an impact on the development of OLC in international hotels in Algeria. Practical implications: Exhibiting the strong interdependency between KM and OL, expatriates emphasize on KM as the learning facilitator. The international hotels keen to realize KM as major process to build OLC. Socialization and internalization reinforce learning by providing primordial sophisticated tacit knowledge. Externalization generates expertise and strategic knowledge. Originality/value: First, the research confirms the effect of KM process using KPC on OLC, stimulating learning at all levels
Hotel restaurants are of great importance in hotels, and the factors for this have so far been considerably understudied. This study investigated the challenges and critical success factors (CSFs) of restaurants owned and operated by five-star luxury hotels in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Four exemplar hotels were studied and 10 respondents responsible for hotel restaurantsâ€™ planning and operations were sampled in this multiple case study approach. A total of 13 challenges were identified, and thematic analysis found 10 common CSFs crucial to hotel restaurants. Among the 10 CSFs, 2 distinctive CSFs were identified playing exceptional roles, including: (1) the inseparable linkage between hotel restaurants and support centers, as well as (2) the inseparable linkage between hotel restaurants and revenue streams. Moreover, this study broadened the retrospective understanding of the term â€œinseparabilityâ€ in service organizations, and also contributed several implications for hotel restaurant managers to incorporate into their businesses.

The objective of this study is to develop a modified European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model with new scores particularly for the hotel industry by using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, a multi-criteria decision-making method. Application of the EFQM Excellence Model for self-assessment is popular, but the evaluation scores underpinning the current EFQM Excellence Model are unchanged for all industries. This affects the accuracy and effectiveness of evaluation. The findings indicate that new Enablers receive a score of 450 points, and new Results receive a score of 550 points, and the deviation is substantial from the conventional EFQM Excellence Model, under which Enablers and Results each score 500 points. Surprisingly, the new Customer Results in the modified EFQM Excellence Model earn a score of 230 points
This study aimed to identify the relative importance of the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that contribute to the success and development of hotel industry in Malaysia. Drawing uponTechnology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Human-Organization-Technology (HOT) fit models, this study developed a theoretical model to predict the significant factors that contribute to the success and development of hotel industry. A two-stage Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) method was applied to test the research model and reveal the importance level of factors in the model. SEM analysis showed that the use of IT, financial performance, benchmarking, service standardization, top management support, customer satisfaction, service quality, hotel interior and exterior design/look, location, employee training and empowerment were significant factors influencing hotel success and development. Moreover, the results of ANFIS showed that customer satisfaction under human dimension was the most critical predictor of hotel success and development. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical success factors of emblematic hotels from the perspective of the guest, by analysing the direct activities that make up the value chain of these types of establishments. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the case study methodology to derive conclusions that contribute to the development of a theory about the success factors of emblematic hotels. The case selected is the Spanish Tourist Parador chain. The authors carried out over a period of two years a data mining analysis of the online comments posted by its guests. Findings: The results indicate that the attributes of location and facilities are critical success factors expected a priori given the nature of the business of such establishments, based on the singular nature of the buildings. Another critical success factor is personnel, which seems to indicate that the Paradors support their business model by employing highly qualified staff, but give less attention to restaurant services or the room, according to guest perceptions. Originality/value: The paper provides required evidence on the critical success factors of emblematic hotels adapting Porterâ€™s value chain, for the tourism accommodation sector, through the analysis of direct value chain activities. In addition, the existing literature is broadened by taking a perspective scarcely studied, the guest perception of hotel establishments, online content posted by the user on the establishmentâ€™s website, rather than simply considering the traditional views of the experts/managers, through structures questionnaires. Besides, the results provide practical and useful implications for the managements of the emblematic hotels under study. Â© 2018, M.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to extend cognitive appraisal theory by integrating customersâ€™ individual difference factors, specifically cultural values. This study examines the effect of individual cultural values on hotel customersâ€™ positive emotions and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) creation intention. Design/methodology/approach: Online surveys were administered via MTurk. Adults with a recent hotel stay were invited to participate in this study. In all, 331 valid questionnaires were used for data analysis. Findings: The results show that collectivism, indulgence and power distance have positive effects on pride, and that indulgence has a positive effect on pleasure. Both pleasure and pride have significant impacts on eWOM creation intention, with the effect of pleasure being stronger. Practical implications: This study deepens hotel practitionersâ€™ understanding of the formation of hotel guestsâ€™ eWOM creation intention and offers suggestions on how to facilitate eWOM advocacy. Originality/value: This study highlights the versatility of cognitive appraisal theory with the inclusion of individual cultural values in the hotel eWOM context. This study delineates the underlying psychological process of how individual cultural values lead to positive eWOM intention via positive emotions that hotel guests experience during their visit. This psychological process is understudied, yet critical for the success of hotel companies that cater to many culturally diverse guests. Â© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.
Purpose This study aims to consider the effects of organizational human and physical resources on customer relationship quality. It also investigates the effect of market and environmental dynamism as external factors in these associations. Furthermore, this study evaluates the mediation effect of customer relationship quality between applied resources and competitive advantage. Methodology This research was implemented in North Cyprus. The number of hotel employees who participated was 297 with response rate of 85%. Convenience sampling method was considered for data collection of this study. Questionnaire was prepared in English and subjected to back-translation process afterwards. Nine employees were considered for the pilot study. Psychological separation and Harmansâ€™ single factor test were conducted as procedural and statistical potential remedies of common method bias. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbachâ€™ alpha were applied to check existence of validity and reliability of questionnaire. Correlation and regression analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between variables and the method of Baron and Kenny (1986) was considered to evaluate mediation effects. Results Findings indicated that managerial competence, employeesâ€™ trait competitiveness and physical resources affect customer relationship quality positively. There is also a positive relationship between customer relationship quality and competitive advantage. Results showed that customer relationship quality fully mediates the relationship between managerial competence and competitive advantage
Determining customers' (guests') perception of service quality and ensuring that service delivery 'gaps' are addressed is critical to ensuring the success of hotels and tourist establishments. This article aims at determining the 'gap' between the hotels customers' expectations (E) and perceptions (P) of the actual service delivered by graded hotels in Ethiopia. Despite limited criticisms, the renowned SERVQUAL instrument was used with minor adaptions, which included adding five items to the Tangibles dimension, and using a 5-point, instead of a 7-point scale. The instrument was deemed valid and reliable through Confirmatory Factor Analysis and determining the Cronbach Alpha co-efficient values. From the response to survey using a self-administered questionnaire, it became evident that of the 415 responses, the majority (54.7%) indicated that their P > E, and 12.5% indicated that P=E
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of four organisational cultural traits of adaptability, consistency, involvement and mission on the three components of customer relationship management (CRM), namely, people, process and technology, in the context of the hotel industry. Design/methodology/approach: Required data are collected with a quantitative approach and a questionnaire adapted from the Denison organisational culture survey and the Mendoza CRM model. The questionnaire was distributed among 364 managers of a chain hotel in the UK and gathered data were examined using the structural equation modelling method. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the four traits of organisational culture (adaptability, consistency, involvement and mission) have positive and significant impacts on the three components of CRM (people, process and technology). A set of theoretical contributions and practical implications was also discussed. Research limitations/implications: The study is conducted with a case study approach
Utilizing a longitudinal approach, this study examines the importance of course subjects in hospitality curriculum from the perspective of the industry professional and identifies changes in the importance of course subjects over the last 10 years using data collected in 2004, 2009, and 2014. Findings suggest that internship/industry experience, preparation for industry employment, leadership, hospitality management and organization, and ethics have been consistently ranked as the most important top five course subjects by industry professionals during the last 10 years. This study identifies a number of course subjects that have been decreasing in importance for the industry and a number of course subjects that have emerged as critical course subjects over time. The most important factor in developing a curriculum that ensures graduatesâ€™ success in their career is the hospitality programâ€™s ability to deal with change. Suggestions and implications for hospitality programs are provided. Â© 2016 The International Council on Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Education.
Purpose â€“ This paper aims to examine the effects of hotel general managersâ€™ transformational leadership (TLS) and department managers (DMs)â€™ organizational commitment (OC) on their departmentâ€™s performance in upscale hotels in Australia. Design/methodology/approach â€“ Data were collected by surveying DMs in four- and five-star hotels. The survey instrument included measures of comprehensive sustainable performance, TLS and OC adapted from the literature. The data were analyzed through factor analysis and regression with a resampling method of bootstrapping. Findings â€“ The findings indicated that TLS influenced hotel departmentsâ€™ non-financial as well as social and environmental performance dimensions directly and indirectly through OC. However, the mediation effect of OC did not exist for financial performance. Research limitations/implications â€“ The key theoretical contribution is the use of performance assessment based on critical success factors of hotel businesses and the bootstrapping regression model. Practical implications â€“ Senior managers should pay attention to TLS qualities when appointing core managers, provide on-going structured TLS training and concentrate on leading performance dimensions for performance assessment. Originality/value â€“ This study responds to the call for leadership research to move beyond its emphasis on individual performance and to address performance more holistically by considering its multidimensionality and the processes underlying effective performance.

As is true for all service industries, achieving customer satisfaction is a critical component of the success of hotel business. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of guestsâ€™ satisfaction with circulation design overall satisfaction with hotel facilities in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. It was motivated by the dearth of published empirical literature on this subject from the Nigerian perspective. A questionnaire survey involving 103 guests drawn from three hotels was conducted between December 2015 and January 2016 in the study area. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor and categorical regression analyses. The result reveals that the guests were more satisfied with internal circulation than external circulation in the hotels. The main sources of dissatisfaction were poor usage of signage to direct pedestrian and vehicular traffic
Employee retention is an issue for all concerned whether service or manufacturing organization, as human resource is the most critical resource for success in the competitive world. The current study is an endeavor to highlight the factors influencing the employees' decision to stay with or leave the organisation. Hence, a careful investigation of the literature on the captioned subject has identified the factors impacting employee retention in general and hotel and accommodation sector in service industry in particular. The research studies are discussed under three major factors like demographic, organizational and personal factors. The studies found that compensation & benefits, reward & recognition, job satisfaction, training & career development, supervisory support, long working hours employee participation, work environment, leadership are most influential aspects for employee retention, ,followed by demographic aspect like age marital status length of service and the personal aspects like , family support, work-life balance, communication, motivation and perceived alternative employment opportunity. The literature review also explored and synthesized literature on employee retention with a view to facilitate a broader understanding of the key theories, issues and challenges related to employee retention in accommodation sector.
Tourism industry is one of the major contributors to the national economy and it is closely related to the development of the hotel industry. Improvement of sub sectors accommodation (hotel) is often related to the increase of tourists to Malaysia. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of tourism on demand of hotel room type and its tariff. In addition, touristsâ€™ behaviours were observed to understand demand of hotel room type because they contribute to the development of hotel industry. Four main factors were chosen as the main factors before choosing a hotel that are price, location, facility and accessibility. These factors were analyse using two methods that are descriptive analysis and multidimensional scalling analysis. The result of this analysis showed that tourist chose 2- star hotels and below as their preferred accommodation. Apart from that, this research further analyse hotel room tariff for the hotel type that was chosen by tourists using simple linear regression. This is useful as a simple guideline for hotel industry. Â© 2015 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.
In recent years, many firms have come to understand that innovation is an important issue in sustainable business management, as it helps improve firm capabilities and competencies. Because of the fiercely competitive environment in the hotel industry, innovation has become a critical factor in the process of hotel differentiation, leading to sustainable business success. However, the literature has not thoroughly examined the role of innovation or the hierarchical structure of the capabilities and competencies in sustainable business management. This study adopts interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers and grey relational analysis to provide a competitive priority ranking for the aspects and criteria that assist firms in decision-making. The study results indicate that innovation in technology capabilities and networking and social capabilities-in addition to competencies in systemic thinking-are the most important aspects of sustainable business management. In particular, this study indicates that to succeed in building a sustainable business in the hotel industry, firms should upgrade and integrate their business technologies, collaborate with actors inside and outside the firm, build trust as well as a shared vision that includes common agreement, and develop competencies in inventive thinking to support innovation and foster changes in strategy, structure, administrative procedures, and systems when necessary.

Background: There is an increasing demand for surgery of degenerative spinal disease. Limited healthcare resources draw attention to the need for cost-effective treatments. Outpatient surgery, when safe and feasible, is more cost effective than inpatient surgery. OBJECTIVE: To study types and rates of complications after outpatient lumbar and cervical spine decompressions. METHODS: Complications were recorded prospectively in 1449 (1073 lumbar, 376 cervical) outpatients undergoing microsurgical decompression for degenerative spinal disease at the private Oslofjord Clinic from 2008 to 2013. RESULTS: Surgical mortality was 0%. A total of 51 (3.5%) minor and major complications were recorded in 51 patients. Three (0.2%) patients had to be admitted to a hospital the day of surgery. Twenty-two (1.5%) patients were admitted to a hospital within 3 months due to surgery-related events. The encountered complications were postoperative hematoma (0.6%), neurological deterioration (0.3%), deep wound infection (0.9%), dural lesions with cerebrospinal fluid leakage (1.0%), persistent dysphagia (0.1%), persistent hoarseness (0.1%), and severe pain/headache (0.4%). All of the life-threatening hematomas were detected within 6 and 3 hours after cervical and lumbar surgery, respectively. CONCLUSION: This series of 1449 consecutive outpatient microsurgical spine decompressions adds to the growing literature in favor of outpatient spinal surgery in properly selected patients. In our study, 99.8% of the patients were successfully discharged either to their homes or to a hotel on the day of surgery. The overall complication rate was 3.5%, surgical mortality was 0%, and only 1.5% had to be admitted to a hospital within 3 months after surgery.

Communication has assumed a critical significance in the success of any organisation that aspires to attain and sustain competitive advantage as well as bring in desired changes in employee's attitudes and performance. While a large amount of literature is available on internal corporate communication (ICC), most of it is ambiguous, conceptual and done from the perspective of developed countries. The primary objective of this study is to model internal corporate communication (ICC) process, examining the nature of the process, the outcomes thereof
Tourism is a major export industry for Thailand. Phuket, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, has been negatively influenced in recent years by a number of crises, including the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). This has limited the travel budget not only for domestic tourists but also those from overseas. Hotel businesses have been particularly affected by the GFC. While hotel managers may not be able anticipate a crisis, it is crucial for them to understand the critical success factors contributing to effective crisis recovery in order to ensure their long-term survival.This research identifies critical success factors necessary for effective economic crisis management through qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with managers of Phuket hotels. The findings of these interviews provide a rich and meaningful understanding of pertinent factors emphasized by managers as important in crisis recovery. Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
The purpose of this study was to apply a combined balanced scorecard and analytical hierarchy process (BSCAHP), which are business decision-making methods, to better understand web evaluation process. The modified BSCAHP used within this study is an evaluation metric composed of four perspectives: technical, marketing, customer, and internal perspectives, and 16 critical success factors (CSFs). Responses of 57 experts were used to determine differences in perspectives and CSFs among three hotel level types. Results suggest that customer perspective is of highest importance in the website design. Hotels can use this evaluation method and invest their money periodically to improve existing website functionality. Â© 2014 Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis.
The concept of performance in hospitality industry is regarded somewhat similarly to the other (service) sector organisations: performance is managed and measured according to the financial (hard) and operational, organisational (hard and soft) and human (soft) approaches (Goldsmith et al, 1997
Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the need for innovation as a means of competitive advantage in the housekeeping (HK) department of five-star hotels in Dubai and consider how the nature of the industry in the region provides particular challenges. Design/methodology/approach â€“ An initial White Paper produced by Amadeus served as the stimulus to conduct a preliminary literature review of innovation in the field of hospitality. The application of innovation was then considered via a content analysis of web sites in Dubai to identify potential candidates for interview. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Senior Housekeeping Executives in two internationally recognized chain hotels in Dubai to better understand whether there is a need for innovation, what types of innovation are important within these HK departments and understand the potential challenges confronting senior managers in fostering innovative practices. Findings â€“ The key results of this study provide interesting insights into the problems of developing and managing innovation within HK operations, highlighting the issues that exist as potential barriers to innovation in terms of the organizational culture and the ownership structure within the industry in Dubai. The research also highlights the fact that much of the innovation introduced within the HK department is focused on utilization of technology and is very much â€œoutputâ€-orientated in terms of improving customer service and creating operational efficiencies. Research limitations/implications â€“ The paper profiles the potential problems confronting the HK department when it comes to identifying and adopting innovation. The paper also highlights the ever-changing nature of the organizational culture and the ownership structure in the five-star hotel industry in Dubai as a critical influence in terms of the perceived importance of innovation as a success factor for the future. Originality/value â€“ The study is the first in a series of research papers that explores the relationship between key stakeholders in the hospitality industry in Dubai as the customer demand alters and they try to identify and implement innovative ideas and concepts that provide return on investment, increased customer satisfaction, sustainability and competitive advantage. It is the first paper that identifies the context and the current internal and external environments and the drivers within the industry in Dubai (five-star) hotels with a particular focus on 2020. This is within an industry that is showing evidence of change management within the customization of the hotel build and specification, and within the adaption of IT, but is looking for innovation within the application of ideas into industry processes.

These critical success factors are people, timing/contextual factors, strategic choices, managerial and operational efficiency, performance/product, and Home Inns' culture. The result also indicates that different factors contributed to Home Inns' success at different developing stages. Furthermore, the implications of Home Inns' successful development are also suggested. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) has emerged as an important strategy for hotels in recent years, allowing rejuvenation of internal processes and activities for improved performance. Although CE is instigated by senior management, middle managers carry out their instructions and hence have a critical role in its success. This conceptual paper evaluates the antecedents or factors that may impact on the middle manager's entrepreneurial role. Hotel middle managers are expected to be more entrepreneurial, but the findings indicate that centralised structures, although ensuring standardisation of systems and processes, result in a 'top-down' approach to leadership and decision making. The middle manager has difficulty communicating issues and ideas to senior management, affecting their ability to be innovative and to take risks on behalf of the hotel. Organisations appear not to be learning from their experiences, with a negative impact on performance. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
Building Energy Efficiency Retrofit (BEER) is an attractive way toward low carbon buildings through improving energy efficiency of high-energy-consumption existing buildings. Sustainable development strategy has been reaching many spheres of human activities. Sustainable BEER aims to integrate the sustainable development concept into existing buildings and retrofit projects. To ensure BEER projects that can fulfill the sustainable development strategy, a project delivery model is one major consideration and Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is one possible market mechanism to deliver energy efficiency projects. This paper aims to use Analytic Network Process (ANP) to develop a model for sustainable BEER under the EPC mechanism. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for sustainable BEER in hotel buildings and critical success factors (CSFs) for EPC have been identified based on a set of interview and questionnaire survey previously conducted by the authors. In this study, the relationships among sustainable dimensions, KPIs, and CSFs are identified through a focus group discussion. Finally, an ANP model is built based on the data collected in the group discussion using the SuperDecision software. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
Purpose: The aim of this research is to explore the implementation of Six Sigma in service organisations. The focus of the investigation is on identifying critical success factors (CSFs), critical-to quality (CTQ) characteristics, tools and techniques and key performance indicators (KPIs), and also to understand the issues emerging from the implementation process. Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory empirical evidence is provided through four in-depth case studies of organisations mainly in Singapore. They include a hospital, a public service organisation, a consultancy service and a hotel. Findings: The major findings include an understanding about the suitability of Six Sigma implementation in service organisations. Management support and team member support emerged as primary success factors. The CTQs include time and cost, while use of soft tools instead of rigorous statistical tools are preferred by service organisations. At the project level, KPIs are understood more as CTQs. Additionally
This study aims to develop and suggest a new 'in-house' quality improvement model for small- and medium-sized hotels. This model is assumed to be fast, simple, and effective for hospitality organisations because it includes the proven critical success factors of Kanji's excellence model. In addition, this article provides a better understanding of how different groups of frontline managers, chiefs, and employees perceive their readiness towards the business excellence culture and performance in 3-, 4-, and 5-star hotels in Tehran, Iran. The survey data used in the analyses include a sample size of 507 managers, chiefs, and lower-level employees. A one-way ANOVA analysis was used to test significant differences and business excellence performance of the proposed model. Using a self-administered Questionnaire, we found that most employees, chiefs, and managers in Tehran gave their lowest scores to quality culture practices and business excellence performance.

Internet technology has become a prominent distribution channel in the tourism industry. Any insight into decision making behavior in the online environment could be critical to business success. We explore the behavior of Iranian tourists in the online environment to specify how different factors affect tourists' decision to use online hotel booking websites. We use a Dominance-based rough set (DRS) in order to model tourists' choice. Besides the novelty of the model being used, this paper is one of the first to explore Iranian tourists' on-line behavior and it also deepens our general understanding of on-line decision making.

The rapid growth of the hotel industry in the first decade of the 21st century forced hotel operators to critically acknowledge the importance of service improvement in order to gain competitive advantage. Therefore, identifying the factors that influence the quality of services of hotels is critical for the success of the hotels. Corporate image and customer loyalty should also be emphasised to ensure the sustainability of the hotels in this competitive industry. Hence, this study is conducted to discover the factors influencing perceived service quality of Malaysian hotels, as well as exploring the relationship between perceived service quality with customer loyalty and corporate image. Additionally, this study is one of the few studies on quality certification related to the demand perspective and also on the mediating role of image on the relationship between service quality and loyalty in the hotel industry.

The hotel industry is taking various initiatives for the sake of food safety. In order to increase the food safety of the food and beverage service, some hotels have gone one step further and adopted the internationally recognized ISO 22000/ food safety management standards (FSMSs) or implementing total quality management (TQM) approach. Few researches were published about the critical success factors (CSF) evaluation of ISO 22000 implementation in hotel industry. To address this gap in the literature, this paper provides an assessment criteria of ISO 22000 implementation in hotel industry by modified Delphi method and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). According above accurate factors, 217 formal questionnaires was design by AHP method. Then, we performed a survey investigation of three types of stakeholders in 29 hotels across Taiwan. The officials and team leaders of hotel inspection and supervision center from government tourism bureau, the hotel front and back of the house middle and top hotel managers and first line managers plus employees participated in the study. Third, 157 available samples in the reclaimed questionnaires were analysis by AHP. The implications of the results for hotel managerial practice are described and future research opportunities are outlined. Â© 2011 Pakistan Journal of Statistics.
Tourism is an important industry for Malaysia, and small and medium chalets (SMCs) play a significant role in aiding the success of the tourism industry. Similar to other small businesses that find difficulty in competing against large companies, many small chalet operators are struggling given the stiff competition posed by large hotels and resorts. The present study aims to identify the perceived critical success factors (CSFs) of SMCs operating along the coastal area and on four islands on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, namely Tioman, Redang, Perhentian and Kapas. Measures from Brotherton and Shaw (1996) and Brotherton (2004) were adopted, and structured interviews were conducted to enhance the richness of data. A total of 56 small and medium coastal chalet (SMCC) and 33 small and medium island chalet (SMIC) operators participated in the survey, and only six respondents agreed to be interviewed. Conferences and banquets were found to be insignificant for coastal and island SMCs. However, SMCCs consider guest accommodation, back of house, and food and beverage as their top CSFs, whereas SMICs rank front office, guest accommodation, and food and beverage as their main CSFs. Qualitative findings provide significant and interesting views to enhance the discussion of the results.
The selection of staff is always a critical success factor for managers in the hospitality service sector. This work focuses on the front-line employees and supervisors of international tourist hotels as the study subjects to explore the direct effects of the individual guanxi networks and POS (perceived organizational support) of hotel staff on their job involvement, and examines the indirect effects of these via personality characteristics. For this paper, questionnaire surveys were utilized
Small-scale businesses play a crucial role in the economies of many developing countries like Turkey. For this reason, it is important to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for successful operation of small-scale businesses in every industry. This study identifies the factors that are critical for success in small hotel businesses. It focuses on CSFs perceived by small hotel managers/owners.The study was undertaken in the Aegean region of Turkey among 155 small hotel businesses.The empirical results indicated that the main critical factors were efficient use of the internet, service quality, financial performance, and marketing. Factor analysis showed that the use of the internet was the most important factor for small hotels. There were some different perceptions among managers/owners as to CSFs, depending on their educational background and work experience. Based on these findings, recommendations for successful small hotel operations are presented. Â© The Author(s) 2011.
Hotel building is a type of high-energy-consuming building and most existing hotel buildings need energy efficiency improvement in China. Energy performance contracting (EPC) is considered a win-win mechanism to organize building energy efficiency retrofit (BEER) project. However, EPC mechanism has been introduced into China relatively recently and many EPCs have not been successful in building energy efficiency retrofit projects. This research aims to develop a set of critical success factors (CSFs) of EPC for sustainable energy efficiency retrofit (BEER) of hotel buildings in China. Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey with practitioners and other professionals were conducted. The findings reveal the relative importance of the 21 number of identified success factors. In order to explore the underlying relationship among the identified critical success factors (CSFs), factor analysis method was adopted for further investigation, which leads to grouping the 21 identified CSFs into six clusters. These are (1) project organization process, (2) EPC project financing for hotel retrofit, (3) knowledge and innovation of EPC, sustainable development (SD), and M&V, (4) implementation of sustainable development strategy, (5) contractual arrangement, and (6) external economic environment. Finally, several relevant policies were proposed to implement EPC successfully in sustainable BEER in hotel buildings. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
There is growing pressure on retailing businesses to act responsibly and comprehensively to manage their waste in a sustainable way. In addition, the practical importance of meeting waste directives and environmental credentials has made most businesses value facilities management services to business. Despite Fuller's and Pitt's observations concerning shopping centre waste management trends, little attempt has been made to investigate the existing solid waste recycling from the UK shopping centre sector. Most previous research on waste minimisation through recycling relates to municipal buildings, commercial office buildings, medical facilities, hotels, educational buildings and industrial buildings. Few studies from other sectors have developed critical success factors (CSFs) for waste management and recycling initiatives. Therefore, this article sets out to identify those primary factors that are considered to be of critical importance to the successful implementation of recycling initiatives in UK retail shopping centres. The article establishes how these factors can be determined and validated in accordance with current perspectives. This article reviews the relative importance of CSFs associated with shopping centres solid waste recycling initiatives in the United Kingdom. By doing so, factoring analysis is used to classify a relatively small number of factor groupings that can be used to represent the relationship among a set of many interrelated variables. This technique is significant to explore the groupings that might exist among the CSFs with regard to UK retail shopping centre solid waste recycling initiatives. Â© 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a set of criteria and an instrument for evaluating upscale hotel web sites and test these in a comparative study of South Korean and the US upscale hotel web sites. Design/methodology/approach: The hotel web sites are assessed by a team of 25 trained evaluators. The study measures and compares the overall effectiveness of upscale hotel web sites and checks the correlation between overall web site effectiveness and size of upscale hotels in South Korea and the US by using balanced scorecard (BSC) approach. To evaluate and analyze upscale hotel web site performance or effectiveness, 14 upscale hotels in both South Korea and the USA are selected. These hotels are selected through Expedia.com or Hotels.com and are rated as either four- to five-star. Findings: The results show that there is no significant difference in the overall effectiveness of the upscale hotel web sites in South Korea and the USA. However, the web sites of the Korean upscale hotels perform slightly better than their US counterparts. The main conclusion drawn is that most upscale hotels in both countries are not effectively using web sites from the marketing and upscale hotel perspectives. Originality/value: The first objective of this research study is to develop a web site evaluation tool for upscale hotels. The modified BSC approach for performance measurement is adopted as the overall framework for the evaluation process. Therefore, BSC performance measurements are adapted and developed to reflect the specific context of upscale hotel online marketing, with an upscale hotel perspective being added to the critical success factors. Also, this study compares actual upscale hotels web page in two different countries and that approach is unique. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine whether managers should have a different approach for the development of very innovative services from that of incremental new services. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a largeî“¸scale survey to examine hotel innovation projects to gain insight about the impact of level of innovativeness on the factors that are linked to new service success and failure. Findings The research results show that there are two global success factors regardless of their degree of newness â€“ market attractiveness and strategic human resources management. Several other factors, however, are found to influence the outcome of incremental projects, such as: service advantage, empowerment, training of employees, behaviorî“¸based evaluation, tangible quality and marketing synergy. For very innovative new hotel services, market responsiveness and preî“¸launch activities are found to be related to success. Research limitations/implications Further research should investigate whether the results are applicable to other countries and other service segments as well as to consider a staff or customer outcome perspective. Practical implications Managers who design new service development processes that are tied to the key success features in innovative or incremental new service development (NSD) increases the likelihood of success. Originality/value The differences in success factors between innovative and incremental new services has not been clearly articulated to date. Innovativeness is linked to levels of risk, ambiguity, necessary resources and complexity and this paper shows that firms should have different priorities and approaches when developing new services.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the development of a business excellence model applicable in the hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach - Two surveys using questionnaires were conducted: the first one for the development of the model's criteria and sub-criteria and the second one for the assessment of the criteria and sub-criteria weights. The model was tested on a number of Greek high-class hotels. Findings - Compared with other business excellence models the proposed model includes criteria and sub-criteria that are more applicable to hotels. The model studies the factors that drive excellence in the hotel sector as well as the importance of these factors as they have been defined by the managers of the hotels. The implementation of the model in a number of high-class Greek hotels shows its applicability and suitability to be used as a benchmarking system. Research limitations/implications - Time limitations, as the project was co-funded by the European Union, have limited the implementation of the proposed business excellence model to a small number of Greek hotels in the area of Crete. Originality/value - The critical success factors for high-class hotels have been identified and a business excellence model applicable in the hospitality sector has been developed.

This paper explores hotel employees' perception on work-life balance issues. In-depth interviews and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. Factor analysis discovered seven factors: (1) enough time-off from work
This study investigates the nature of critical success factors (CSFs) in China's budget hotel operations and development from the perspectives of various stakeholders, including customers, industry professionals, government authorities, and hotel investors. Understanding the differences in CSFs becomes extremely important to the success of the budget hotel segment in China. Results indicated that while all five dimensions of CSFs (i.e., physical product, service quality, price, promotion, and location) were deemed important by the industry professional, government authority, and hotel investor, the sequence of importance differed substantially among these groups. By contrast, customers were primarily concerned with service quality issues, indicating service quality was still the core customer expectation in China's budget hotel market.
Franchising is a strategic partnership formed by the franchisor and the franchisee, and consequently partner selection between the franchisor and the franchisee is critical to the long-term success of a franchise. However, the literature has primarily taken the viewpoint of franchisors, but failed to explore the perspective of the potential franchisees. As China represents a significant growth opportunity for international hotel franchisors, this study examines the perspective of China's domestic hotel operators regarding franchising and analyzes a mix of factors that may affect such perspective. The study of 182 Chinese hotel general managers shows that China's hotel practitioners have considerable interest in franchising and are knowledgeable about the concept as it pertains to hotels. The findings indicate that the length of work experience and educational background of Chinese hotel operators may influence their franchising preferences. Hotel chains that have strong brand awareness, supportive centralized reservation systems, and offer relatively high returns on investment at relatively low franchise fees, are most attractive to potential Chinese franchisees.

Hotel sector was the first one to employ joint venture in China after its 'Open Door Policy' in 1978. In transition from production unit to business unit, the operating system of China's State-owned hotels (SOHs) has changed greatly. Though its hotel industry has become more open, many of the tourist hotels are still State-owned enterprises (SOEs) today, and they account for over half of the loss of all hotels in the country. This study aims to find out: first, critical issues causing those problems facing the SOHs
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how firms can enhance their service quality to increase customer satisfaction and thus financial performance? In answer to this question, four factors (i.e. employees, perceived service quality, customers, and financial performance) are critical to the success of service firms. The purpose of this research is to provide a research framework that examines relationships among employees, perceived service quality, customers, and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - This research develops valid and reliable instruments to measure employee training, a shared understanding, perceived service quality, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. Structural equation modelling is employed to test hypotheses following the research framework. Findings - Drawing on a sample of 129 hotels, the results of this research show that employee training has an influence on perceived service quality. A shared understanding among employees plays a critical role in enhancing perceived service quality. In addition, customer satisfaction mediates between perceived service quality and financial performance. Originality/value - This research illustrates that management may keep the consistency and reliability of perceived service quality by increasing the capability of employees through training and a shared understanding. In the literature, the relationship between perceived service quality and financial performance has shown a mixed picture
Although there are similarities between hotel and other commercial property developments, hotel development has unique characteristics and requires specific management expertise. Hotels are usually 'single-use' properties, whose primary revenue is generated from a service-based industry. They have a market value directly related to their ability to generate future net income by means of their operations. The essence of successful hotel property development lies in understanding these unique characteristics. Various critical success factors for hotel development are identified in this article, and incorporated into a hotel property development framework, establishing a practical 'road map' for successful hotel developments. The validity of the proposed hotel property development framework has been assessed by intensive direct interviews with hotel development professionals.
In response to the United Kingdom's government's desire to improve the performance of tourism, hospitality, and leisure small medium-sized enterprises, this article analyzes the performance measurement processes within 10 best practice organizations. Related to contemporary approaches to improving business performance in the management literature, performance measurement approaches are analyzed using the balanced scorecard framework. An exploratory case study approach using the balanced scorecard as the theoretical framework was taken to explore and elicit critical success factors in performance measurement. Results revealed that four key concepts drove measurement and performance evaluation systems across the sample. These were the exercising of budgetary control with a view to increasing total revenue, the undertaking of customer relationship management as a means of improving quality of service and customer retention, the necessity for strategic management in managing internal business processes, and collaboration (both inter and intra) to drive innovation and learning. The article also proposes a balanced scorecard template for hotels. Â© 2005 Sage Publications.
This article focuses on a project designed to investigate the validity of the results obtained from a prior exploratory study undertaken to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) in 'UK Corporate Hotels'. The CSF approach and its application to hospitality and other types of business environment are briefly reviewed prior to an explanation of the survey methodology adopted in the study. The empirical results reveal that only three of the original 59 CSFs derived from the 1996 study were found not to be statistically significant and that nine of the ten CSF item sets possess reasonable Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Finally, the significance and implications of the results are discussed. Â© 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.
"This study explores the nature of critical success factors (CSFs) in UK budget hotel operations through a questionnaire survey designed to ascertain the relevance and importance of a range of factors referred to as critical in the extant academic and trade literature. From a usable sample of 239 questionnaires the results show that budget hotel unit managers from the leading brands largely agree with the criticality of the factors stated in the literature, this being verified via the independent t-test and reliability analysis results that show most of the CSFs to be highly statistically significant (p<0.001) and the set of CSF items to be consistent (Î±=0.9360). The data analysis, via principal components analysis, also facilitates the creation of a parsimonious model that identifies two dimensions and five CSFs as being the ""most critical""."
In Canada, CEF is considered a standard adjuvant regimen for treatment of node-positive breast cancer. Many centers in the United States have adopted AC-T. There are no randomized trials comparing the two regimens. At the inception of this study, AC-T appeared to be superior to AC alone (CALGB 9344). However, new data suggest that there is no difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between AC-T and AC. There is some concern over the cost difference between AC-T and CEF, and this study seeks to determine the global cost of the two regimens, the source of the cost, &amp

Many companies and their employees accept that learning and management development can provide mutual benefits, but find it difficult to free up the time and money to make this possible. Finding time and resources for training and development can be especially difficult in the hospitality industry, where operational imperatives often override longer-term considerations. This paper reflects upon the critical success factors of a pilot management development programme in Marriott Hotels in the UK, so that it might be internalized and delivered in a range of Marriott properties world-wide. The conclusion is that action learning is a challenging medium for learners and tutors alike, but that the process can be an enjoyable one for all concerned. It is possible to internalize such programmes if care is taken with both â€œhardâ€ and â€œsoftâ€ critical success factors. Â© 2000, MCB UP Limited
For a variety of reasons an increasing number of local authorities and other agencies have turned to tourism as a means of economic development. To date, however, the level of activity among policy makers has not been matched by research that might inform their deliberations. Although the importance of demand-related issues â€” such as the promotion of particular destinations â€” is recognised, this paper shifts the focus to the neglected issue of sector supply. It argues that if tourism is to contribute to economic development that is sustainable, private- and public-sector facilities (such as attractions or hotels) must be nationally â€” and often internationally â€” competitive. The paper proposes a model for understanding the competitiveness of organisations in the sector and reports the findings of its application in a case study of east and south-east London.

The objective of this study was to uncover the critical success factors that have significant value-added impacts on corporate acquisitions in the lodging industry. The findings of this study indicate that the most important acquisition objective for acquirers in the lodging industry is to accelerate the growth of their firms. One of the most significant findings of this study was that hotel executives gave relatively higher importance to pre-acquisition management strategy than to the post-acquisition integration process. In terms of post-acquisition performance evaluation criteria, measures from a value-based management (VBM) approach received the highest rank in evaluating the economic gains of corporate acquisitions in the lodging industry.

This paper reports the results of an exploratory survey into the nature, and relative priority, of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in UK Hotels. This study is unique, both in terms of the investigation of the CSF concept/approach in UK hotels and the disaggregated application of this approach to individual departmental/functional aspects of hotel operations. This identification of CSFs, and associated Critical Performance Indicators (CPIs), by practising managers constitutes an interesting, contemporary, and informative picture of the key factors, and their relative priorities, facing academic researchers and unit level managers in the UK hotel industry. Finally, the paper concludes by presenting a 3 dimensional model which embraces the dimensions of Objectives, CSFs and CPIs and correlates these with a number of typological categories.

The consensus of a panel of 20 marketing and sales managers with major hotel chains based in North Carolina is that most companies are not ready to implement a 100-percent service guarantee. To date, a handful of national chains offer such a guarantee: Comfort Inn, Howard Johnson, Promus's brands (e.g., Embassy Suites, Hampton Inns), and Sleep Inns. On further questioning, the panel members suggested that the core lodging elements and practices needed to ensure the success of the guarantee policy are service standards and employee training. In addition, properties must maintain strong housekeeping and maintenance practices and make continual quality inspections. On the other hand, the panel discounted the age of the property and its FF&E as a critical factor in the successful implementation of a satisfaction guarantee. Â© 1996, Sage Publications.

Synopsis Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) expedites neutrophil recovery in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with or without autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT). The limited cost analyses available in patients undergoing ABMT support a cost reduction of about 25 to 35% with rGM-CSF therapy, relative to placebo, generated primarily by decreases of 20 to 30% in hospitalisation costs reflecting reductions in length of hospitalisation. Results of 1 trial show equivalent cost savings of 40% versus placebo with either rGM-CSF or recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) in patients with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. Whether reduced infection rates seen with rGM-CSF may lessen costs of antimicrobial therapy is undetermined
Innovative revenue generation by Canadian hospitals is drawing increasing attention. After a critical examination of the literature, we classified these into six areas: clinical/diagnostic insured services, clinical/diagnostic non-insured services, hotel services, retail services, administrative services and financial activities. We concluded that many Canadian hospitals are engaging in innovative revenue generation activities, the success of such activities has been mixed, there are many factors to consider when selecting revenue generation activities, many aspects of innovative revenue generation involve sophisticated business and risk management skills not traditionally required in hospital management, and implementation of many such activities requires support from the hospital board, hospital staff and medical staff.

ABSTRACT. Dalens, B, Viallard, JL, Raynaud, EJ, Dastugue, B. (DÃ©partement d'AnesthÃ©sieâ€RÃ©animation, Laboratoire de Biochimie MÃ©dicale et Enzymologie, Clinique MÃ©dicale Infantile, Hotelâ€Dieu, Clermontâ€Ferrand, France). Enzyme studies and neonatal brain damage. Acta Paediatr Scand, 70:743,.â€“The authors report a doubleâ€blind study of 57 fullâ€term newborn infants prospectively subjected to clinical, electroencephalographical, blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and developmental examinations. Four enzymatic activities were measured in blood and CSF: aminotransferase (ASAT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD). Close relationships of enzymatic levels with psychomotor outcome are reported. In blood, ASAT and CK seemed to be the most important determinations, allowing thresholdâ€values to be suggested. In CSF, LD and HBD were the determinations the most closely related to psychomotor events at age one. This method seems to be of theoretical as well as practical importance in evaluating neonatal brain injury. Copyright Â© 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved
